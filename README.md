# Creating a Diversified Stock Portfolio Using Clustering Analysis



#### About
The aim of the project is to create a diversified portfolio of stocks using clustering analysis and back test its performance against the historical data of a stock index. For this we look at the S&P500 index, that is deemed to be the most accurate quantifier of the US economy. S&P500 is the comparable standard for many funds in the marketplace.

The attempt is to use K-Means clustering based on Euclidian distances to understand the effect of different parameters that affect the stock performance. The comprehension of stock performance will be aided by dividing stocks into clusters that have stocks with similar performance. These clusters provide valuable information to create stock portfolios.
